# ELEC291-LAB5


### Introduction:
In this lab, we will be using the EFM8 board to measure the RMS voltages of any two given AC signals and the phase difference between the reference and test signals in degree.

### Extra Features:

1. Portable design; No USB Connection is Needed
2. High Frequency Measurement Range: 15Hz-60,000Hz
3. High Voltage Measurement Rangeï¼š200mV-3.2V
4. Adjustble Pull-up Resistors Allow Us to Change the Rise Time of the LM393 Output to Get More Stable Readings
5. Auto-backlighting circuit is used so that users can read the measurements with ease in a dark environment
6. High Slew Rate Op-amp Used, TLE2082 gives us fatser and more accurate signal reponse at high frequencies 
7. Input Voltage Buffer Used to Protect the Signal Generator and the Circuit

### BreadBoard Layout:
#### Note:
1. The bottom two slider switches are used for changing pull-up resistance of the output pins of LM393
2. The Slider swithces on the left is used for selecting frequency range and input-protection
